Game Overview
Game Title: Endless Run

Game Summary: I got inspiration from the Google dinosaur game. I used to play this game in elementary since they had all the other game websites blocked. It was too easy to learn and create the code. I understood the different aspects of using the PyGame extension. I was able to learn how to import backgrounds as well as audio. This is a simple game; you are a black box trying to jump over red spikes.

Core Gameplay Loop: You press space to trigger a jump function. Once you do that, the game verifies if your hit box hits the hot box of the spike; if it turns out to be true, the game will show the end screen. If it shows false, the game will continue and generate a random spike. 

Gameplay Mechanics
Controls: press the space button to jump, the R button to restart, and the Esc key to exit the game. 

Core Mechanics: Jumping,
Level Progression: They advance by trying to get the highest points by jumping over the spike. 
Win/Loss Conditions: This is a personal win. You try to get the most, and the game can last as long as it is active.
